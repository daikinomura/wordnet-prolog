Wordnet-prolog includes new versions of the WNprolog databases,
generated by Eric Kafe, and bundled with a copy of the original
WNprolog-3.0 documentation (c) 2012 Princeton University.

WNprolog-3.0BF is a bugfix release of WNprolog-3.0.
It fixes some known problems, including the transitive hyponym bug.

WNprolog-3.1 is a Prolog version of WordNet 3.1.

The accompanying wnprolog.pl program implements common
WordNet use cases, and is intended later to also include
more formal checks, like f. ex. transitive loop detection.
